		Around this time last year, I had just committed to spending the next four years of my life at Cornell University.
    Amidst all the excitement, I remember being particularly nervous about my wardrobe. First impressions are so important,
    especially when you're coming into a new school with no friends. I was worried about whether my peers would like my
    clothes and whether they would judge me for it. Well, for those of you reading this and wondering the same thing - I have
    some good news. College fashion is about as versatile and diverse as it gets. It is completely acceptable to dress up and
    wear heels to class, just as it would be to show up in sweats and a t-shirt. However, here are some of my favorite outfits
    that you probably already have in your closet!</p></center><br>

		One basic outfit that you absolutely cannot go wrong with is a flowy shirt with some loose shorts. This is such a summer
    wardrobe staple, and for good reason. (1) It's extremely comfortable to wear. When you're sitting through lectures all day
    and have to run from club meetings to office hours, you want to make sure that what you're wearing allows you to move easily.
    There's nothing worse than being stuck in class for an hour, unable to adjust into a comfortable position, because your shorts
    are too boxy. So the number one tip to keep in mind is to always make sure that what you're wearing is comfortable, and bonus
    points if it's cute too.</p></center><br>

		(2) Perhaps the most important item in your outfit are your shoes. Whether you opt for flats, vans, or even heels, make sure
    that you're going to be able to work in them. If you want to wear heels to class - go for it! You'll feel cute and that's
    awesome. However, there is nothing cute about trying to walk down a steep hill and falling over on your butt in front of the
    entire school. Trust me - I speak from experience. I had thought that I would be able to get away with wearing heels to class,
    but Cornell and its hilly terrain had to disagree. The bottom line is: whatever shoes you choose to wear, know that there is a
    chance you have to keep them on your feet for the entire day, and go from there.

		College is a time for experimentatio and personal growth. Play around with your style a little bit, there's no cookie cutter idea of
    "college fashion" - everyone discovers and rocks their own sense of style. Don't be afraid to wear something bold or try something
    new!</p></center><br>
