    <h1>Be BOLD</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom:60px; text-align:center;">BY: HANA | DATE: 4.1.17</p>

    <p>Growing up in Los Altos, California, I saw the classic Bay Area uniforms
    on the daily, which consisted of either a. a black turtle neck (or some other
    plain, drab tee) and a pair of ill-fitted jeans a la Steve Jobs (fun fact: he
    went to our High School) or b. a Warriors or SF Giants Jersey and basketball shorts.
    <br> </p>

    <p> While these outfits are perfectly acceptable, I have to say these styles
    were not quite for me. Since I didn't have too many sources of inspiration
    around me, I turned to YouTubers, Pinterest boards, and fashion blogs for
    fashion advice. It was during my Junior Year that I discovered the power of
    an all black outfit. It was a life changing experience. I definitely encourage
    you to try it if you haven't already. It immediately slims your figure by hiding
    any imperfections you have, and makes you look more mature (especially important
    if you're in high school still struggling to find yourself). The best part is,
    you never have to think about whether your top and bottoms match, since they're
    both the same color - of course they match.
    <br> </p>

    <p> I have to say, one of my favorite parts of moving to NYC has been having
    so many sources of fashion inspiration around me at all times. Everyone is so
    well dressed, and many follow The Big Apple's unofficial all-black-only outfit
    rule.
    <br> </p>

    <p> While I do think it's impossible to go wrong with an all black outfit,
    I've picked up a few different ways to elevate the look.
    <br> </p>

    <p> These photo above and the photo below are by fashion blogger Wendy Nguyen
    from Wendy's Lookbook. I love how they are both "all black" looks, but include
    accents that make the outfits pop. I've really been loving the look of lace
    lately because they add a little something to every outfit without being too
    over-the-top. I also love the bits of gold in her outfits: the gold watch in
    the first photo, the gold platform on her shoes in the second. They stand out
    and catch our eye against the all black canvas that the rest of her outfit provides.
    I've found that these accents are especially crucial if you're trying to take photos!
    <br> </p>

    <p> This third photo is a much more simple approach to the all black outfit.
    Even here, there is contrast, though not with colors. Her shiny leather jacket
    contrasts with the rest of her outfit and adds interest to her otherwise plain outfit.
